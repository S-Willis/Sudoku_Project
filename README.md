# Sudoku_Project
Small Sudoku project with a brute-force solver.    
Running Game.py will give you the option to play the game or solve the grid.  
Running Sudoku.py will open a window with a sudoku grid displayed. Click to select the square you wish to edit and then type with the keyboard which number you want to enter. The change will not be made if you are wrong.  
Currently there are issues but this is an ongoing project.
